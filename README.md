# Ultex

This Github Pages site hosts the WebGL build of my 2D shmup game Ultex. The game is mostly inspired by the R-type and Touhou franchises.

This site can be accessed at [https://lewishay.github.io](https://lewishay.github.io)

## Software used
- Unity, for game development

Upon committing to this repository, GitHub Pages will rebuild the pages in the site.
