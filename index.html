		<h2>Ultex (2023-2025)</h2>
		<p>Ultex is a 2D space shooter game.</p>
		<p class="left">When I started this project, I had no experience using the language (C#) or the framework (Unity).
			The idea was to teach myself something new while also exploring a passion of mine.
			Development was started in 2023 and finished in 2025, although this was intermittent and the
			project was not being actively worked on for most of 2024.</p>
		<p class="left">
			Technologies used:
			<ul>
				<li>C# and Unity</li>
				<li>Aseprite for sprites/animations/background</li>
				<li>Reaper for music and sound effects</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>RandoChoice (2021-2022)</h2>
			<p>RandoChoice is an Android app which will pick a random option from a list of choices.</p>
			<p class="left">I became interested in developing an Android app as I liked the idea of creating something
				that I could install and use on my phone. The recommended language for Android development is Kotlin
				which appealed to me as it was similar to other languages I knew at the time, so this project allowed
				me to explore a new language without a steep learning curve.</p>
			<p class="left">
				Features include:
				<ul>
					<li>Input a list of choices to be randomly selected from</li>
					<li>Save, load, and delete lists from local storage</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="left">
				Technologies used:
				<ul>
					<li>Kotlin</li>
					<li>Gradle</li>
					<li>Android Studio</li>

		<h2>Smaller miscellaneous projects & experience</h2>
		<p class="left">
			<ul class="spaced-list">
				<li>A monitoring dashboard for a team I worked with, written in Scala and using the Play framework,
					which interacted with DevOps APIs (Jenkins) to pull back health status of build and deployment
					jobs, and service versions per environment</li>
				<li>Various browser userscripts written in Javascript that modify or improve a website. Use cases
					include: widening content to fit better on a 16:9 screen, adding buttons to autofill data,
					customising colours or images, hiding content</li>
				<li>A simple Discord bot written initially in Javascript (2017) and then reworked in Scala (2025).
					This bot was added to a server and was able to respond to basic commands</li>
				<li>This website!</li>
